From the very beginning of the Javascript program, we start using the execution context. It is there from the start up to the very end of the program. Because of that fact, we are led to a conclusion that that part of the language is crucial to understand before we move on. The execution context is a fundamental part of the language. On the stack, we are going to pushing and popping execution contexts, the things that are created when the functions are called and destroyed when functions return.
One more important thing that exists from the very beginning of the program is 'global context', a context that possesses a global object, and that which possesses all built-in methods that come with the language (String, Number, Random...). One of the interesting facts is that when you run a JS file, even if its empty, the 'global context' along with global object will be made.

So, what kind of stack are we talking about?

It's LIFO stack, last in, first out. It functions in a way that the last element that made into the stack, is being processed first. In a more concrete way, when we call a function and put it into the 'execution stack', the current function execution is put on hold until the newly created function is done running. When the function is done, the context related to that function is being popped out from the stack and the program resumes.
