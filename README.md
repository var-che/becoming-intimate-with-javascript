# Becoming intimate with Javascript (animated series)

Hi all. This is my attempt in exmplaining some of javascript concepts using animations. I strongly believe that words should be complementing images, or animations in this case, and that using only words to describe something, just might not be enough. Of course, keep in mind that these animations are only a model.
